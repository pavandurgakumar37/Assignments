    <h1>Angular Description</h1>

        AngularJS Material[38][39] was a UI component library that implemented Material Design in AngularJS.[40] The library provided a set of reusable, well-tested, and accessible UI components. In January of 2022, the library was closed, as announced on their official website

        AngularJS set out the paradigm of a digest cycle. This cycle could be considered a loop, during which AngularJS checked if there were any changes to all the variables watched by all the $scopes. If $scope.myVar is defined in a controller and this variable was marked for watching, Angular would monitor the changes on myVar in each loop iteration.
        This approach potentially led to slow rendering when AngularJS checked on too many variables in the $scope every cycle. Mi≈°ko Hevery suggested keeping fewer than 2000 watchers on any page

        In July 2012, the Angular team built an extension for the Google Chrome browser called Batarang,[42] that improved the debugging experience for web applications built with Angular. The extension aimed to allow for easy detection of performance bottlenecks and offered a GUI for debugging applications.[43] For a time during late 2014 and early 2015, the extension was not compatible with recent releases (after v1.2.x) of Angular.[44] The last update made to this extension was on April 4, 2017.
