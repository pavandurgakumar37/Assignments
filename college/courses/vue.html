    <h1>Vue Description</h1>
    <p>
        Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced "view"[4]) is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.[10] It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members
    </p>
    <p>
        Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer only.[4] Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages.[12]

        Vue.js allows for extending HTML with HTML attributes called directives.[13] The directives offer functionality to HTML applications, and come as either built-in or user defined directives.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vue was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in several projects. He later summed up his thought process: "I figured, what if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight."[14] The first source code commit to the project was dated July 2013, and Vue was first released the following February, in 2014.
